# Tutorial 4: Reviewing and Editing Data

**Duration:** 4-5 minutes  
**Target Audience:** All users  
**Prerequisites:** Uploaded file with processed data

---

## Script

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:20)

**[VISUAL]** Show data review grid with readings

**[NARRATION]**
> "After your file is processed and normalizations are applied, you'll want to review your data before generating reports. In this video, we'll cover how to review, search, and edit your readings."

---

### Scene 2: The Data Review Grid (0:20 - 1:00)

**[VISUAL]** Pan across the data grid showing all columns

**[NARRATION]**
> "This is the Data Review Grid. Every reading from your file is displayed here with all its details."

**[VISUAL]** Highlight each column:
- Reading ID
- Location
- Room
- Component (original)
- Normalized Component
- Substrate
- Normalized Substrate
- Lead Content
- Result (Positive/Negative)

> "Notice there are columns for both original and normalized names. This lets you see exactly what changes were made by the AI."

**[VISUAL]** Point to positive/negative indicators
> "The Result column shows whether each reading is positive or negative based on the 1.0 mg/cm² threshold."

---

### Scene 3: Searching and Filtering (1:00 - 1:45)

**[VISUAL]** Click on search box

**[NARRATION]**
> "With hundreds of readings, you'll want to find specific data quickly. Use the search box at the top."

**[VISUAL]** Type "door"
> "I'll search for 'door'... and instantly the grid filters to show only readings containing 'door' in the component, location, or room fields."

**[VISUAL]** Clear search, show other filter options
> "You can search by any text in your data. Clear the search to see all readings again."

**[VISUAL]** Show stats bar
> "The stats bar at the top updates to show you counts: total readings, how many are positive, how many are negative, and the percentage."

---

### Scene 4: Inline Editing (1:45 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL]** Click on a cell in the grid

**[NARRATION]**
> "Need to fix something? Just click on any cell to edit it directly."

**[VISUAL]** Click on a component cell
> "Let's say this component name needs adjustment. I click on it..."

**[VISUAL]** Edit the value
> "...type my correction..."

**[VISUAL]** Press Enter or click away
> "...and press Enter or click elsewhere to save. The change is applied immediately."

**[VISUAL]** Show different editable columns
> "You can edit the normalized component, normalized substrate, and other fields this way. Note that some columns like Reading ID and Lead Content are locked to preserve data integrity."

---

### Scene 5: Bulk Editing (2:30 - 3:30)

**[VISUAL]** Show checkbox column

**[NARRATION]**
> "What if you need to change multiple readings at once? That's where bulk editing comes in."

**[VISUAL]** Check several rows
> "First, select the readings you want to change using the checkboxes. I'll select these five door-related readings."

**[VISUAL]** Click Bulk Edit button
> "Then click the **Bulk Edit** button."

**[VISUAL]** Show bulk edit dialog
> "A dialog appears where you can set the new values. I can change the normalized component, normalized substrate, or both."

**[VISUAL]** Enter new component name
> "I'll set the normalized component to 'Entry Door Frame'..."

**[VISUAL]** Click Apply
> "...and click Apply. All five readings are updated at once!"

**[VISUAL]** Show updated grid
> "This is a huge time saver when you need to correct multiple readings or reclassify components."

---

### Scene 6: Understanding the Stats (3:30 - 4:00)

**[VISUAL]** Zoom in on stats bar

**[NARRATION]**
> "Let's look at the statistics displayed at the top of the grid."

**[VISUAL]** Highlight each stat:
> "**Total Readings**: The number of readings currently displayed (or total if not filtered).
>
> **Positive**: Readings with lead content at or above 1.0 mg/cm². These indicate lead paint presence.
>
> **Negative**: Readings below the threshold.
>
> **Unique Combinations**: The number of distinct component/substrate pairs. This is important because HUD/EPA classifications are done per combination."

---

### Scene 7: When You're Done (4:00 - 4:30)

**[VISUAL]** Show the action buttons

**[NARRATION]**
> "When you've finished reviewing and making changes, you have several options:"

**[VISUAL]** Highlight Generate Summary button
> "**Generate Summary** - Creates your HUD/EPA compliant report."

**[VISUAL]** Highlight Export to Excel
> "**Export to Excel** - Downloads all data to an Excel file for external use."

**[VISUAL]** Highlight Re-Normalize button
> "**Re-Normalize** - Runs AI normalization again if you've made significant changes."

---

### Scene 8: Wrap Up (4:30 - 4:45)

**[VISUAL]** Show completed grid

**[NARRATION]**
> "The Data Review Grid gives you complete control over your data before generating reports. Take the time to review—accurate data means accurate compliance reports.
>
> Next, we'll dive into understanding the HUD/EPA summary reports."

**[VISUAL]** End card

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. Review both original and normalized values
2. Use search to find specific readings quickly
3. Inline editing for single changes
4. Bulk editing for multiple readings at once
5. Always review before generating reports

## Demo Data Needed

- Processed file with 200+ readings
- Some intentional errors to demonstrate editing
- Mix of positive and negative readings
